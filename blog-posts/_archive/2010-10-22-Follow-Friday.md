## Twitter is great for keeping up with what your neighbors cat is up to, but it's also a great resource for keeping up with other developers. Following some advice from a co-worker I've put together a small list of devs that I follow that I think you should follow too.

I hate the fact that my tweets will [eventually disappear][2]  or get lost amidst floods of tweets in other twitterers feeds so I've posted a few developers that I would recommend other follow on twitter.

[@chrisbloom7][3]  - Smart and witty web developer. A fellow TDD and ruby enthusiast, co-worker at Wake}fly, open source developer, mac hobbyist. Keep on truffle shuffle'n.

[@johnbubriski][4]  - Calm, cool and collected .net developer and another of the Wake}fly twitteristas. He's talked me down off the architecture astronaut ledge more times than I can count. You should also [check out his blog][5] .

[@digitalbush][6]  - Developer who talented and driven to finding the best solution to a problem, not just the fastest. Author of the [hotlinkr][7]  project as well as [several popular jQuery plugins][8] . [Check out his blog as well][9] .

[@edgesmash][10]  - C# developer that is smart, creative and very insightful. He has [an excellent blog that you should read][11] .

[@Kevin_McManus][12]  - Student at WPI for Computer Game Development (video game companies take notice), co-worker at Wake}fly, smart and eager to learn. Not afraid to be outside his comfort zone. Kevin also has [a blog that is very much worth checking out][13] .

As far as I'm concerned, having a list of recommended follows on twitter is just as important as having a recommended reading list or recommended blog/feed reading list.

So, thats my list, who would you recommend to a another developer?
