## A friend asked me the other day if I could recommend some podcasts for him to listen to. 


I've been meaning to post this for about a year now, and I'm not sure why it took me so long. I get asked what podcasts I listen to by my developer friends a lot. I always try to throw a few out there but I can never remember the whole list - which is actually kind of sad because the list isn't that long.


Most of these podcasts are around the 1 hour mark for time, except Hanselminutes which is usually about 40 minutes.


So without further delay, here is the list of podcasts that I enjoy!


*One last delay: My pal, [John Bubriski][1]  has a great list of podcasts (and many other things) over on his [Developer Resources][2]  page.*


*One more one last delay - I've marked podcasts that have strong language with a NSFW.*


General Nerd Podcasts

**The Geekbox** - [Website][3]  - NSFW, Just a group of hilarious geeks/nerds talking about videogames, tv, movies and comics. Can&#39;t pick any favorites for this as every episode is awesome.
