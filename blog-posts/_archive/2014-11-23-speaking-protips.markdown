When I was a kid I hated speaking in public. I would get so nervous that I would break out in a cold sweat, get super nauseous and completely freeze up, unable to speak a lot of the time I stood up in front of a classroom. So I started looking for more occasions to speak out, presentations during class and after school events for starters. I took public speaking and debate in college and started to build up my speaking abilities.

So while I'm not an expert presenter, like, at all, I'm still no stranger to public speaking. Since being that nervous frozen kid in grade school,

Talking in front of a crowd and sharing things I've learned are things that I really enjoy and try to get better at every chance I get. Here are some tips that I've either gotten from smarter people, or come up with on my own that I think are the keys to improving as a public speaker.

### Don't just know your audience, Adapt to them
Every presenter offers the same advice to newbies: "Know your audience". Knowing your audience is great advice and you should absolutely work on your presentation with a certain group of attendees in mind. However, you have to be able to adapt your speaking style and presentation on the fly. If your material isn't working - your jokes aren't landing right or you seem to be losing the audience - you have to adapt and change things up. Don't just plow ahead with your presentation. Know your audience, but also adapt to them too.

### Be Excited.
This might seem like a "yeah, duh" kind of point, but I see a lot of presenters who - for whatever reason - are just not that into their talk. IF you can't be excited about what you are talking about, why on earth are you speaking?

### Never. Ever. Read your damn slides word for word.
Nothing will make you lose an audience faster than reading every word on your slides to your audience. How do you avoid this? I'm glad you asked.

### Your slides should be incredibly simple.
Your slides should be short enough for the audience to read them, and then start focusing back on you. You are the reason the audience is there. If your slides have too much content, your audience will stop paying attention to what you are saying - which should be where all the real content is.

To see some examples of what I'm talking about, check out [these](http://slides.com/jaredbarboza/hello-node-js#/) [slides](http://slides.com/jaredbarboza/let-s-build-2d-game-engine#/) that I've used at conferences before.

### Live coding, only if you practice.
If you intend on putting fingers to keyboard during a presentation make sure you prep. I've done it a few times, and it has *never* gone flawlessly. Not even close. Practice, practice, practice and have _several_ backup plans. Things will fail.

### Code Camps are your friend. Go to them.
Code Camps are great forums to try out your new presentation or practice one you're building up for a bigger conference. First, they are free (usually) and very accepting of new speakers (some conferences only allow people who have spoken at other conferences). Second, they are a lot like an open mic. There will be other first-time presenters there and you can talk to them before and after to compare notes, and figure out what worked and what didn't.

### Record yourself.
I don't do this nearly enough. Recording yourself giving a presentation is a really solid way to get better at it. You'll notice words that you say too often, or common audience questions and you can get a sense for your pacing and delivery.

### Ask for feedback before you start.
This is an idea I got after my last talk a week or so ago. I want to throw up a single slide *at the start of the talk* with a very short bit.ly link to a wufoo or google docs form where attendees can provide feedback for that specific talk.

Showing it at the start is important so that it's not an after thought during my close, and the audience can jot it down for later or even go there and fill it out during the talk.

### And Finally: Never. Ever. Read your damn slides word for word.
It's so important it's here twice.
