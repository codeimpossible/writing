## A recap on how this years PAX was, from my point of view

A full day after PAX and I'm still reeling from it. There were so many great moments: hours of Cut-throat Caverns with friends, ahowing our game to hundreds of people, meeting lots of other indie devs.

One of them that really stuck with me was when we had a group of college-aged guys standing around at the indie mini booth watching one of their friends play Rock Kickass; they started cheering and laughing when he dodged a shot or made a tricky jump.

The spectators were just as into the action as the guy/gal playing!!!

Around the same time we had a group of kids playing our mobile infinite runner game and they were laughing and yelling, making Rock jump and shoot enemies. I got hooked right then. I don't think I've gotten that kind of raw reaction to something I've made during my 10 years of software development or at any point before that.

It was really a great feeling.

### Thursday, Dawn of the first day
Thursday was interesting, John and I spent most of the day in the Westin lobby - the hotel is connected to the convention center that hosted PAX - working on Rock Kickass and RK Runner. The folks over at BL Gamer were [doing a live broadcast](http://www.blgaming.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=990&p=3130#p3130) and several of their team members/friends came over to take a look at Rock Kickass. They seemed really excited with what we showed them but we couldn't stay to chat because we had to rush off...

...To the Indie Megabooth mixer! Bocoup hosted a drinkup/meetup for the indies participating in the megabooth on Thursday night. It was pretty fun, we didn't know anyone so after hanging around awkwardly for a few minutes John and I decided to grab our laptops and continue hacking on our games. This turned out to be a great way to meet people.

Turns out that no game dev can resist talking to you when you have your laptop open and a game is running and code is up on the screen. Who knew? We met a lot of really cool people that were fantastic to talk with. The indie space is filled with really friendly people, a fact that I am always amazed by.

### Friday, Dawn of the second day
On Friday John and I stayed in our "stomping grounds" - the Westin lobby - until about 2pm. We were making great progress on RK Runner and felt like we deserved some floor time to reward ourselves. We were on the floor until 5 when we went back to the lobby and worked on the games... yeah, we know, we're total nerds at this point but we were under a lot of "pressure" to ship this game by Saturday morning.

Luckily we finished RK Runner and published it to the android marketplace just as John took off to a Valve party. I headed out and did a few hours of cut-throat caverns with some friends. When John and I headed out @ 9:30 our game was live!!!

### Saturday, Dawn of the third day
Saturday was by far, the most dificult day. We arrived at the exhibit hall around 8:30 and began setting up. We met our volunteers - who were great Iain was the best volunteer we could have hoped for, he kept us relaxed and focused.

At about 9:50am, ten minutes until the floor opens, shit starts to get pretty real. You can hear the crowd getting amped up and they start announcing the countdown until pax starts over the PA system. It's exactly like the beginning of a round of Team Fortress.

Then the doors open and the first thousand people are just running by you at top speed so they can get in line to play the AAA titles they missed yesterday.

It's the most unbelieveable sight you'll ever see. They just come streaming into the area like a horde of infected zombies desperately trying to get to play the new ducktales game.

Honestly, the rest of the day, from 10am until 6pm is a complete blur of me and john repeating the same thing over and over again, showing people the games and refining our pitch until it just spews out of us without prompting. I think we even pithed the Alientrap guys at the indie party later that night!

### Sunday, bah, you get the gag by now!
Sunday was just a chill day. I went to PAX in the afternoon, hit the capcom booth for a megaman anniversary pin, took some pictures of the AAA area and then just hung out in the indie side for a while.

It gave me some good down time to think about what we might be able to do with Rock Kickass over the next 6-8 months. New gameplay ideas, new plot edits and even some new characters. I'm not sure if we'll be able to deliver on our promise of Rock Kickass by the end of the year but we'll find out.
