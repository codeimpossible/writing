## Getting to the general vicinity of the NERD center is easy. It's the last part that can be tricky.


I've been going to the Microsoft NERD Center for a few months now (about 2-3 times a week) for various user groups and community events.


I try to bring new people with me as much as possible and I find that getting them within shouting distance of the building is easy, it's that last 1/4 mile or so that is hard. So I'm throwing this post up here so I can link people to it in the future.

Park and enjoy your free pizza, event speakers and networking!
