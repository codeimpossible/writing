## A look back on the crazy that was 2012

During our recent snow-storm I spent a while thinking about the last twelve months. 2012 was a very awesome year. No, scratch that. 2012 was a **perfect** year.

## I GOT MARRIED
On the 16th of June, I got married to my girlfriend and counter-part of six years. Our wedding was outdoors, it was sunny, perfect. It was and still is the best day of my life.

It's been almost 8 months of being married and I won't say it's been easy but it's been worth it.

### Castle Frag
John and I started a video game company: [Frag Castle Games](http://fragcastle.com). We're currently working on our first title: Rock Kickass!

### MonkeySpace
In October I got a dream gig. Co-presenting at Monkeyspace in Boston! I got to present on Micro-ORMs with Mr. Bubriski - yeah, he had a great year too :D. You can view our presentation [here](http://johnnycode.com/MassivelyDapperSimpleData).

We got to hang out with Dean Ellis, Bob Familiar, and Chris Bowen talking about how to deliver games to Windows 8. Honestly, Microsoft really impressed me with how much they are willing to do for _nothing_ to help indies and small-level game makers onto the windows 8 marketplace.

### Frag Castle contributed to MonoGame!
John proved that he is - in fact - the freaking man by porting one of our proof-of-concept games from XNA to MonoGame **during the conference** and then he contributed some improved game controller code back to the MonoGame library.

### Rock Kickass
In November, Github announced that they were starting a Game-off. Developers across the globe entered by forking a repo on github and began coding away. John and I - repping Frag Castle Games of course - were one of the entries. We built our game: Rock Kickass in 30 crazy days using HTML5, JavaScript and ImpactJS.

Then the unbelieveable happened. *We actually won*.

Well, we were in the top 5. Third, to be exact.

I remember looking over my co-workers shoulder as he brought up the Github blog post announcing the winners. All I could do was repeat "You've gotta be fucking kidding me" over and over until John called me.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" was all I heard when I answered. We were both so blown away that we honestly didn't know what to do next. It took about a week to decompress after that.

2012 was a beast of a year. I've never worked harder and never achieved more. I'm excited to see what happens this year. John and I are gearing up for PAX at the end of March and Rock Kickass is looking better than ever! 2013 looks like it'll be a pretty awesome year too!
