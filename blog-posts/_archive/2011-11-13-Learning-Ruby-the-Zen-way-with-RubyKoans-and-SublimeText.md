## I've been using ruby for about 2 years now, but I'm always looking to improve my skills. 


Python, Ruby, TDD and writing plugins for an awesome text editor. What more could you want from a blog post?


I stumbled across [RubyKoans.com][1]  a few days ago. Most blogs and books teach you ruby by showing you examples and then, once you have a grasp on the language, you&#39;ll be told about TDD.


Ruby Koans takes a different approach. Specifically, RubyKoans teaches you Ruby and TDD by  forcing you fix tests that are broken. Each test case encompasses a different part of the language. Some people think that this is like [being taught to swim by getting thrown into the ocean][2] , but I think RubyKoans does a fantastic job keeping the lessons tight, focused and informative.


Getting RubyKoans working on your system is really simple. Download and install Ruby, then just download their examples and extract them somewhere on your drive. Their website has all the instructions to get you up and running on *nix or windows.


Working your way through the tests is pretty easy. Launch a new command line window, or a terminal window and run the ruby koan path_to_enlightenment.rb:


    $ ruby /path/to/your/rubykoans/dir/path_to_enlightenment.rb


After a few seconds you should see an output similar to below:


[![][3] ][4] 


And this is how rubykoans leads you through each of the lessons. You are presented with a failing test and need to go in and fix it.


Your main body should fully realize the ideas you set into motion in the introduction section. Keep your posts short and to the point as shorter blog posts are easier to read and remember.


Use a consistent style in your writing, once you've picked a style that suites you and your audience, stick to it.


Be your own editor. Before you publish your post, go back and re-read it. Does it sound like you? Does it make sense? Does it get right to the point?
