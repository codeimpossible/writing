## A thank you to everyone that made our PAX unforgetable

_I'm still decompressing from PAX. I haven't fully wrapped my head around what went down over the last four days, it's been a lot of sleepless nights, and bat-shit crazy days. I'll have a more detailed post put up in a few days. But I wanted to post a thank you to everyone that we met and talked to, and to those that made PAX amazing._

The Frag Castle team had an awesome time showing Rock Kickass and Rock Kickass Runner to the PAX attendees. Our friends/families, the other indies showcasing, and the people behind the Indie Megabooth all made the experience one I'll never forget.

Special thanks go out to the following people - games they were promoting are in parens:

* Jesse & Lee from [Alient Trap](http://alientrap.org) (Apotheon)
* Matt & Chris from [RagTag Studios](http://ragtagstudio.com) (Rays the Dead)
* Bill from [Asinine Games](http://www.asininegames.com) (El Chupacabra)
* Ben & Eric from [Trinket Studios](http://trinketstudios.com) (Color Sheep and Orions Forge)
* All of the PAX enforcers
* each and every person that stopped to talk to us on Saturday
* All of the Indie Megabooth volunteers and Kelly Wallick

Kelly worked tirelessly to make sure everything we needed was there, every question we had was answered. She was awesome and we wouldn't have had a prayer without her.

However, My wife deserves a huge shoutout here. She handled ordering every piece of swag that we handed out, staying up until 2am on Saturday making all of the t-shirts that we gave away. She is my #1 fan and I love her with all of my heart. Without her I wouldn't be living my dreams.
