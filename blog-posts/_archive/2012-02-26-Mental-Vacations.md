## I came up against some - seemingly - insurmountable problems the other day. So I left work and played video games.


I was working on a problem and things weren&#39;t going my way. Tests that *should* be passing weren&#39;t, errors that didn&#39;t seem possible were popping up and in just about every way imagineable shit was falling apart.


I remember thinking "*I can do this. If I can just solve this next problem I'll be in a better spot.*" and sometimes this works. I amp myself up, I actually do fix the problem and can go back to being productive. Not this time. These problems seemed too big. I couldn&#39;t focus because everything I had tried had failed. Twice.


So I left.


That's right. You heard me. It was 3pm and I stood up from my chair at work, grabbed my coat, drove home and played Star Wars: The Old Republic for the rest of the night. I didn't startup my work laptop. I didn't check emails. I disconnected and let my brain relax.


Your brain is a muscle and when you're working on mental problems all day it can get worn out and tired just like your legs, biceps, or any other muscle in your body. Your brain needs a vacation.


When that happens you need to disconnect - completely - and go do something that doesn't involve thinking. I play video games but you could easily play music, go for a jog, go fishing, hiking, whatever. The point is to get your brain the time it needs to recoup so you can come back the next day and attack the problem(s) head on.


I got up the next morning, drove into work, and when I sat down at my desk within 5 minutes I had noticed three things that I was doing **that were completely and utterly wrong**. Also, they were really stupid mistakes, a sign that my brain had just given up. I fixed them and things started working, builds are passing, tests are running and I&#39;m back to being productive.


But I would have sat at work for the rest of the day and never realized my errors unless I had that time to reboot.


Don't be afraid to realize that you're not making any progress and take a mental vacation and come back into the office swinging. You'll find that those problems that seemed so insurmountable yesterday are probably childs play after your mental vacation.
